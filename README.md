Author: joltar#6972
Creating a simple Better Discord Pluygin which allows a 'Toggle' option to selected / in focus videos
Toggling the focus on playing videos from 'default' to maximised/fullscreen
This is my first time using Javascript; the code quality will be sub-par as I firgure out how to use the BDApi even though this is a simple plugin
